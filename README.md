# Hi, I'm Devesh Kumar Suthar

I'm a B.Tech student at IIT Guwahati with a passion for building intelligent solutions that bridge the gap between software, data, and automation. I love turning complex problems into impactful, data-driven products and I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to challenging projects.

## What I'm Focused On

**Diving deep into Data Science & AI**: Currently mastering Deep Learning, advanced Machine Learning algorithms, and Data Analytics with SQL and Python (Pandas, NumPy).

**Building Full-Stack Web Apps**: Honing my skills with the MERN stack to create responsive and scalable applications.

**Exploring Robotics & Control Systems**: Applying my knowledge of embedded systems (STM32, Arduino) and PID controllers to solve real-world automation challenges.

## My Toolkit

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C/C++, SQL

**Data Science & ML**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

**Web Development**: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (MERN), TailwindCSS

**Electronics & CAD**: STM32, Arduino, Control Systems, AutoCAD, Fusion 360

**Tools**: Git, Docker, Linux, RESTful APIs

## Highlighted Projects

**Inverted Pendulum Robot**: Designed and built a two-wheeled balancing robot using a PID controller to maintain an upright position.

**Object Suspension PID Controller**: Engineered a PID control system for stable object levitation using air thrust, reducing settling time by 68%.

**Social Media Automation Tool**: A Node.js tool using the Gemini API to streamline content management across platforms.
