### Hi, I'm Devesh Kumar Suthar ðŸ‘‹
I'm a B.Tech student at IIT Guwahati, passionate about electronics, software development, and automation. My work focuses on building solutions that bridge the gap between physical systems and software. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills to challenging and innovative projects.

**What I'm currently working on:**

* **Software Development:** Deepening my expertise in **Web Development** using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
* **Electronics & Control Systems:** Exploring **embedded systems** and **robotics**, with a focus on applying my knowledge of microcontrollers (STM32, Arduino) and CAD tools like AutoCAD and Fusion 360 to real-world control problems.
* **Machine Learning:** Expanding my understanding of ML concepts through hands-on projects, including image classification and handwriting recognition.

### My Highlighted Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills across different domains:

* **Inverted Pendulum Robot:** Designed and built a two-wheeled balancing robot that uses a PID controller to maintain an upright position.
* **Puddle-Based Inverted Pendulum:** Developed a control system for a puddle-based inverted pendulum, demonstrating stability and precision in a challenging environment.
* **Object Suspension PID Controller:** Engineered a PID control system for stable object levitation using air thrust. This project reduced settling time by 68% through parameter optimization.
* **Social Media Automation Tool:** A Node.js-based tool with Gemini API integration to streamline content management across platforms.
